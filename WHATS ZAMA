What's Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol?(Zama Protocol)

➙The Zama Protocol is a cross-chain privacy layer that enables confidential smart contracts on any existing blockchain(L1 or L2).
➙It is not a new standalone chain,but an overlay“confidentiality layer"that works atop popular networks like Ethereum or Solana.
➙It uses Fully Homomorphic Encryption(FHE) to perform computations directly on encrypted data,ensuring complete data privacy inputs,outputs and state remain encrypted throughout execution.
➙With Zama,smart contracts are end-to-end encrypted ensuring no one(not even node operators)can view the sensitive data .At the same time it maintains public verifiability and composability.
